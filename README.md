# MLB-RookieFuturePredictor
This project aims to reveal which MLB Rookie stat serves as the greatest indicator for career success in the league.

## Models
The code for this project is broken up into two main sections. The first model was designed to predict whether a player will still be present
 in the league five years after their rookie season. The second model is designed to predit the WAR (Wins Above Replacement) stat for a player 
 five years following their rookie season. Both models are built in Python and use sklearn functionalities and classifiers.
